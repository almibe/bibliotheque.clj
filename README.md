# bibliotheque.clj
Library Tools for Clojure

bibliotheque.cli is a batteries included Clojure library that attempts to provide idiomatic support in Clojure for work with formats and standards used in libraries.
This project's goal is to go beyond simply wrapping Java libraries with a Clojure api (infact this project uses some of those) but instead focus on integrating those libraries with a shared api and provide commonly needed functionality.
It is designed to work well inside applications as a normal dependency as well as to be used directly from the REPL for interactive work.
